[COLOR cyan][B]What does this addon do?[/B][/COLOR]
My Subscriptions allows you subscribe to TV Shows in multiple addons. When playing an
episode from the library you then get the choice of addon to play from.
All addons that have subscription functionality are supported as long as you set them up
as described in step one/two below.


INSTRUCTIONS
STEP ONE
Make sure each addons TV Directory is set to its userdata folder and contains "show" in 
the folder name. Most addons create a folder for you automatically.
i.e. GOtv creates the folder .../userdata/addon_data/plugin.video.GOtv/TVShows

Directory search is NOT CASE SENSITIVE, so you can call it "Show", ShOw", "shOW". It just has
to contain that word.

STEP TWO
Delete existing TV Series directories from your current XBMC library source.
Go to Videos/Files and use the context menu to remove your TV Series source

STEP THREE
My Subscriptions will create this directory: 
.../userdata/addon_data/plugin.video.mysubscriptions/TV_SUBSCRIPTIONS

You can change this in settings, but you need to set content (TV Shows) on whatever folder you choose.

[COLOR cyan][B]How it works[/B][/COLOR]
Subscribe to your favourite series in whatever addons you prefer.
The addons will still run their own subscription service, but they will update directories
that aren't linked to your XBMC Library.

[B]My Subscriptions[/B] will run it's own subscription service.
This service will scan your userdata/TV Show folder for show names, create new strm files
and update your library

When playing an episode from the library the addon will scan other addons' TV Show directories
for the same series/episode stream. 
If only one addon strm is found the episode will autoplay.
If more than one addon has the episode you will be able to choose which addon to play

Note that it might take a second more to start playing your selected stream.
