Universal Parental Control (UPC) allow you to lock videos based on their MPAA rating. Enabling this function means that, depending on your settings, you will be asked for a PIN when playing a video.
You have 30 seconds to enter your PIN and/or configure any options. After 30 seconds the video will exit.

[COLOR gold][B]Settings[/B][/COLOR] 

Set the following:
[COLOR cyan][Enable Parental Control][/COLOR]: Turn parental control on/off

[COLOR cyan][Set watershed time][/COLOR]: Set a time between 15:00 and 23:00 or set to "ALWAYS ON"
Any video will play without needing a PIN after this time, but controls are automatically turned 
on again at 6AM	
				  
[COLOR cyan][Set minimum watershed rating][/COLOR]: There are 4 settings (movie rating first).......
a. "G or TV-Y/TV-Y7/TV-G"
b. "PG or TV-Y7-FV/TV-PG"
c. "PG-13 or TV-14"
d. "R/NC-17 or TV-MA"
Any movie or tv show with a rating EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN your setting will require
a PIN before playing (unless it is past your watershed time) 

[COLOR cyan][Set PIN][/COLOR]: PIN is set to "0000" by default. I suggest setting a 4 digit PIN as it's easier to 
enter on a remote.

[COLOR cyan][Set action if no rating is available][/COLOR]: Sometimes a rating is not available. Set your option 
here to either play them or require a PIN.

[COLOR red]Locking the Parental Control settings[/COLOR]
If your kids know their way round the settings window you can lock them to your PIN.
In the Parental Controls menu you will see a new link to [LOCK Parental Control Settings]. 
If you enter the correct PIN the Parental Control settings tab will be locked. To unlock, perform the same action.

MPAA ratings are sourced directly from either the file metadata or grabbed using the metahandler module. 
If for some reason there is no rating available you will be given the option to set your own rating when playing the movie/tv show. You will need your PIN to save the rating and/or to play the title when no MPAA rating is available. When you set a rating it will be saved for future plays.

If UPC cannot derive the video name you will be prompted to configure the addon. Enter our PIN and you will have 3 options:
1. Exclude the addon from Parental Control: All videos will be allowed from the addon
2. Exclude the mode from Parental Control: This will exclude on the specific channel/video list from UPC, allowing all videos to be played
3. Configure the addon: UPC will list all actions in the current plugin url. Select the action that contains the movie/show name i.e. "name=Avatar"

The addon works by grabbing certain file/plugin information when a video starts playing. 
On rare occasions no information is passed to UPC. When no information is available you will be prompted for your PIN to play (you will see the mpaa rating as [notfound])
