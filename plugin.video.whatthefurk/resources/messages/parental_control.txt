Parental controls allow you to lock videos based on their MPAA rating. Enabling this function means that,
depending on your settings, you will be asked for a PIN before playing a video.

[COLOR gold][B]Settings[/B][/COLOR] 
The Parental Control settings can be found after the auto-view settings. You can open the settings page
from the context menu.

Set the following:
[COLOR cyan][Enable Parental Control][/COLOR]: Turn parental control on/off

[COLOR cyan][Set watershed time][/COLOR]: Set a time between 15:00 and 23:00 or set to "ALWAYS ON"
Any video will play without needing a PIN after this time, but controls are automatically turned 
on again at 6AM	
				  
[COLOR cyan][Set minimum watershed rating][/COLOR]: There are 4 settings (movie rating first).......
a. "G or TV-Y/TV-Y7/TV-G"
b. "PG or TV-Y7-FV/TV-PG"
c. "PG-13 or TV-14"
d. "R/NC-17 or TV-MA"
Any movie or tv show with a rating EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN your setting will require
a PIN before playing (unless it is past your watershed time) 

[COLOR cyan][Set PIN][/COLOR]: PIN is set to "0000" by default. I suggest setting a 4 digit PIN as it's easier to 
enter on a remote.

[COLOR cyan][Set action if no rating is available][/COLOR]: Files played directly from "My Files" or "Furk Search" will
not have an MPAA rating. Set your option here to either play them or require a PIN (this also applies from the Movie/TV
section if no rating can be found)

You can use the PIN or your Furk account password to play a title.

[COLOR red]Locking the Parental Control settings[/COLOR]
If your kids know their way round the settings window you can lock them to your PIN.
In the MAINTENANCE menu you will see a new link to [LOCK Parental Control Settings]. If you enter the correct
PIN (or your Furk password) the Parental Control settings tab will be locked. To unlock, perform the same
action from the maintenance menu.

MPAA ratings are sourced directly from the meta file that's saved when you browse menus (from tvdb or tmdb). 
If for some reason you don't download meta......or if there is no rating available.....you will be given the
option to set your own rating when playing the movie/tv show. You will need your PIN to save the rating and/or
to play the title when no MPAA rating is available.
When you set a rating it will be saved for future plays.
