[COLOR cyan][B]Changes in version 1.5.2[/B][/COLOR]

[COLOR gold][B]1. Added pagination to all IMDB searches[/B][/COLOR]
The setting [COLOR cyan][IMDB/NUMBER OF MENU ITEMS][/COLOR] has been changed. You can now 
select from 25|50|100|150|200|250 (default is 50).
All IMDB searches will limit results-per-page based on your setting. A
"Next page" link has been added to the bottom of each page, giving you the
option of browsing thousands of titles.
There is also a link to return to the root Movies or TV section.

[COLOR gold][B]2. Play archives with one click[/B][/COLOR] 
A new setting [COLOR cyan][FURK/Play archives automatically][/COLOR] has been added.
Enabling this will reduce the number of clicks required to play a title. If an 
archive contains only one video file it will be played without first viewing the
file itself. If the archive contains more than one video file it will switch to
browse mode.
A new context menu option has been added to the archive list if you
want to browse the contents and use download or download_play mode.

[COLOR gold][B]2. Added Parental Controls[/B][/COLOR] 
[B]Parental Controls are LIVE in this version![/B]
A new settings section has been added....hidden away after the auto-view settings.
Set the following:
[COLOR cyan][Enable Parental Control][/COLOR]: Turn parental control on/off
[COLOR cyan][Set watershed time][/COLOR]: Set a time between 15:00 and 23:00 or set to "ALWAYS ON"
Any video will play without needing a PIN after this time, but controls are automatically turned 
on again at 6AM					  
[COLOR cyan][Set minimum watershed rating][/COLOR]: There are 4 settings (movie rating first).......
a. "G or TV-Y/TV-Y7/TV-G"
b. "PG or TV-Y7-FV/TV-PG"
c. "PG-13 or TV-14"
d. "R/NC-17 or TV-MA"
Any movie or tv show with a rating EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN your setting will require
a PIN before playing (unless it is past your watershed time) 
[COLOR cyan][Set PIN][/COLOR]: PIN is set to "0000" by default. I suggest setting a 4 digit PIN as it's easier to 
enter on a remote.
[COLOR cyan][Set action if no rating is available][/COLOR]: Files played directly from "My Files" or "Furk Search" will
not have an MPAA rating. Set your option here to either play them or require a PIN

You can use the PIN or your Furk account password to play a title.
[COLOR red]Locking the Parental Control settings[/COLOR]
If your kids know their way round the settings window you can lock them to your PIN.
In the MAINTENANCE menu you will see a new link to [LOCK Parental Control Settings]. If you enter the correct
PIN (or your Furk password) the Parental Control settings tab will be locked. To unlock, perform the same
action from the maintenance menu.

MPAA ratings are sourced directly from the meta file that's saved when you browse menus (from tvdb or tmdb). 
If for some reason you don't download meta......or if there is no rating available.....you will be given the
option to set your own rating when playing the movie/tv show. You will need your PIN to save the rating.
This rating will be saved for future plays.

Just like to say a big thanks to BSTRDMKR for the text box code. over the next few releases I'll be using it to
add help sections to each menu.
