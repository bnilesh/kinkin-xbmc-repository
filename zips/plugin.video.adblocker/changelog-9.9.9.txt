9.9.9
Fixed script error if no ad-related addons found

9.1.1
Who you gonna call?

<<<<<< Instructions >>>>>>>
By default, this will update the ad time every 15 minutes so ads won't run.
Change the frequency in settings
If the xbmc.ads module name changes just change it in settings
If the ads settings folder changes just change it in settings

Sets the time in all settings where the setting id contains the word "time"
Add up to 5 key words if the setting id changes (in case the setting id magically changes)

Option to pre-load all installed addons to try and stop that annoying ad the first time you run the addon.

I can't guarantee this to work for long, but if anything changes...............................
